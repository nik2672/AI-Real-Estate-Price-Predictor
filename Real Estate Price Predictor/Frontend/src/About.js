              Our project aims to explore and assess housing prices and market trends across various property types in Melbourne, Australia. By leveraging machine learning techniques, our team has developed an AI model designed to accurately predict house prices based on the features you desire for your dream home. Additionally, our model analyzes fluctuations in Melbourne's real estate market using carefully curated datasets.

              We have developed our AI price prediction model through testing and comparing various models such as regression, classification, and neural networks, selecting the best to incorporate into our website. Our neural network uses a deep architecture utilizing three hidden layers, consisting of 128, 64, and 32 neurons respectively using RELU, allowing us to capture complex patterns in our data. By providing accurate price predictions, our model empowers users to make informed decisions, whether they are buyers, sellers, investors, or real estate professionals, helping them navigate the complexities of the housing market with greater confidence.
